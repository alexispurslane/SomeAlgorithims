# Round 1
## MapReduce

### Lines Of Code Stats
Note: I'm adding blank lines and newlines here and there. The point is not the shortest possible amount of code, but good, idiomatic code that you should write, but as short as possible.
Also, I am comparing the *base* language, with no extra frameworks or libraries. (And no, JavaScript doesn't get a handicap, even though it is a crippled language.)

- JavaScript: 16LOC
- Elixir: 9LOC
- Erlang: 6LOC
- Haskell: 6LOC

Winner: Haskell & Erlang

### Development Speed Stats
Note: This includes looking at documentation and Googling stuff.

- JavaScript: By far the longest, at around 30mins
- Elixir: ~20mins
- Erlang - ~15mins
- Haskell - ~13mins

Winner: Haskell

### High-levelness Stats
Note: This is partly a matter of opinion.

- Haskell - the most high-level and easy to understand.
- Elixir - A close second.
- Erlang - A little more low-level, but not too bad.
- JavaScript - Very low-level (I basically had to reimplement an Object type that I could reduce over) and slightly confusing.

Winner: Haskell & Elixir

### Error Message Helpfulness Stats
Note: In order of worst to best.

- Erlang - The pit of insanity. Basically every error is: "Error before end." And thats it.
- JavaScript - Pretty awefully bad.
- Elixir - OK, not great, but good and do the job.
- Haskell - Really awesomely good and detailed, and WITH SUGGESTIONS TO BOOT. But definiatly not as good as they could be, especially with the sometimes strange type info.

Winner: Haskell
